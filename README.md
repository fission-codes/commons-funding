## Open Collective

Fission is a [fiscal host on Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/fission). We host a number of collectives, and will be posting special projects to the [Fission Platform](https://opencollective.com/fissionplatform). Best for recurring funding and custom tiers of donations and services.

## Gitcoin

Gitcoin is used to attach bounties directly to issues on Github. It's best for one off, code centric bounties where you want to use tokens to pay.
